# Data analysis project

Here you will find our analysis of the datasets relating to the parcoursup platform. It is available as a **jupyter notebook** or **HTML file** for easier reading under the names "Main.ipynb" and "Main.html". As the files are too large to be displayed by GitHub, you'll have to download them.

You'll find all you need to know about datasets, as well as an analysis and an attempt to develop a small predictive model.

The objectives are also described at the beginning of the document.

You'll also find datasets in csv format in the "DataSet_Voeux_RepEtablissement" and "DataSet_VoeuxParSpe" folders.
